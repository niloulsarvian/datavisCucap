# datavisCucap

This is my repo for my data visualization experiments for my CuCap research. 

The .csv is so you can visualize my data [Sarvian et al. in prep]

The .ipynb is the python code so you can look at what code was needed to make this plot (using the package Bokeh)

The CuCapplotly.html is the html file for the plotly attempt of this same figure. 

The index.html is so I can host the Bokeh plot on github and send the link to others.
